# Avocado Framework

Avocado is a framework with a set of tools and libraries to help with automated testing. Native tests are written in Python and they follow the `unittest` pattern, but any executable can serve as a test.

Whether you want to automate the test plan made by your development team, do continuous integration, or develop quick tests for the feature you're working on, Avocado delivers the tools to help you out.

Please, read our [quick guide](./quickguide.html) to get an idea of what avocado can do. If you want to go further, check out our [installation](./installation.html) instructions and take a look at the [full documentation at readthedocs](https://avocado-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)!
